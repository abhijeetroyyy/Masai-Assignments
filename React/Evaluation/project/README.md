The web application should have multiple pages:

Login Page
Home Page
Product Details Page
The web application makes use of context API to manage authentication state. The initial/default state should be { isAuthenticated: false, token: null, email: null }.

The Navbar should be visible on all pages and have the following features:

When the user is authenticated/logged-in:

Display the logged-in user's email on the left side of the navbar.
Display a link to the Home Page on the right side.
Include a LOGOUT button beside the Home Page link that logs out the user and redirects to the login page when clicked.
When the user is not authenticated/logged-out:

Display a link to the Login Page only.
All pages except the Login Page should be accessible only to logged-in users. If a user is not logged in, they should be redirected to the Login Page. This means that only the Login Page is a public route, while all other pages are private routes.

Home Page: As soon as the user visits the Home Page, it should make an API call using Axios to the products endpoint API Docs to get the list of products and then display that list of products as cards in a grid layout:

3 cards per row for large screens and above
2 cards per row for medium screens and above
1 card per row for small screens
Each product card should display the Title, Category, and Price, and include a More Details button that redirects to the Product Details page. Include three select buttons for sorting and filtering products:

Sort by Price with options "Ascending" and "Descending"
Filter by Category with options "Men", "Women", "Kids", and "Home Decor"
The products should be rearranged based on the selected sort and filter criteria.

Bonus: Ensure that even when the user refreshes the page, the products remain sorted and filtered correctly. Refer to the useSearchParams hook.

Also, include proper loading indicators and error message components to show appropriate loading and error messages as needed.

Product Details Page: This page should display all the details of a single product. The page should have the following features:

Display a visually appealing card containing all the details of the product. As soon as the page loads, retrieve the product id from the URL and make an API call to get the details of the product with that product id API Docs.

Include an Add to Cart button that opens an Alert Dialog with the text "Are you sure you want to add this item to cart" and two buttons Cancel and Confirm. Clicking Cancel should close the Alert Dialog. Clicking Confirm should show a toast message with the text "Item added to cart" and close the Alert Dialog. The toast message should be visible for 2 seconds. (Note: Maintaining cart state is not required; the functionality described will suffice.)

Ensure proper loading indicators and error message components to show appropriate loading and error messages as needed.

Login Page: This page should contain the following elements:

An input box for email (focus should be on this input box as soon as the page loads).
An input box for password.
A login button that makes a POST request to the login API endpoint API Docs. If the request is successful, it will redirect to the Home Page. If the request is unsuccessful, it will display an error message. The successful response returns a token, which can be saved in the AuthContext. Maintain a context to keep track of isLoggedIn, token, and email.
